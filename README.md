# ImageStitcher

The Panorama Image Stitching project is an application designed to automatically create panoramic images by identifying key points in two or more input images and seamlessly blending them together. The project leverages computer vision techniques and image processing algorithms to detect and match features in the input images, align them correctly, and generate a high-quality panoramic output.


- Features
-- Key Point Detection: The project employs feature detection algorithms, such as Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) or Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), to identify distinctive points in the input images. These key points serve as reference markers for alignment and stitching.

-- Feature Matching: The application performs feature matching between the key points detected in different images. This process establishes correspondence between the points and enables accurate alignment.

-- Image Alignment: The project aligns the input images based on the matched key points. It utilizes techniques like RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm to estimate the transformation between the images, including translation, rotation, and scaling, ensuring proper registration.

-- Image Blending: The aligned images are seamlessly blended together to create a smooth transition between them. Various blending techniques, such as linear blending, multi-band blending, or feathering, may be employed to achieve natural and visually appealing results.

-- Panorama Generation: Once the alignment and blending processes are completed, the project generates the final panoramic image. The resulting panorama preserves the visual content from all input images, providing an extended and wider view of the scene.
